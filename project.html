				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<br>
The project that eventually I would like to create is an application and/or game that will help people defeat procrastination and help them focus on the work ahead. With the world dominated by technology and social media it is hard sometimes to find the motivation to complete important tasks without being distracted. This application will reward you for the amount of time you do not open another application on your smart device and help you keep you on track. Once the rewards come in some play ability will come into the application so you can also enjoy your time playing a game and taking a rest from all your hard work you achieved whilst not being distracted.
<br><br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<br>
The average user on spends up to two hours a day on social media and up to four hours a day on their smart device. Unfortunately I am one of the people who procrastinate as much as I  possibly can with the ability to have technology in front of my face.  The idea of this application is not only to attempt to have people get off their phone, but to enjoy the outside world and not give into technology temptations whenever they possibly can. Not only would I benefit from an application like this but many people who grew up with technology would have similar dillemas.
<br><br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<br>
The features of this application would involve three main components;
	<ul>
<li>Application lockout</li>
<li>A playable game with a endless play ability system</li>
<li>Other features to appeal to more audiences</li>
</ul>
<b>Lockout</b>
<br>
This application will use a similar strategy to other applications that help procrastination such as "Forest" - an application that rewards you by letting you build a miniature forest on your phone after setting a timer and not opening other applications. In the application that I would like to design after setting those timers it will reward you with an in-game item for e.g. a booster pack of cards if it is a virtual trading card game or a new armour set if it is a Role-playing game, or maybe a new building for your city if it plays like a real time strategy game.
Another system that could be used with the lockout system is being linked to your smart devices GPS. The further you travel in this period or the amount of steps you take you will also be rewarded, similar to "Pok√©mon Go!" - a game you collect virtual monsters and visit landmarks in real life the more you travel. And if possible it could be linked to your Fitbit application and reward you for more calories burnt encouraging a healthier lifestyle.
<br>
<b>Game</b>
<br>
The trickier part of developing an application similar to this is not to make users so dedicated to the game where they cheat using third party software or spend way too much time on the game defeating the entire purpose of the application, but to give you endless fun in small dosages.  The game will be designed on quick games approximately 5 to 10 minute rounds whether it be a trading card game or an online RPG battle arena.
<br>
<b>Other Features</b>
<br>
The application should not just suit the gaming community but audiences from all different interests. Other features the application may implement to meet these other interests could involve;  a workout program where you can finish a workout to claim rewards. Setting a to do list with time it should take to finish also receiving rewards.
To involve those who do not want to play games features that may be added such as a decorative simulator, for e.g. you may finish your workout and add a tower for your city, a system for in game points to be turned into currency to support a charity of their choosing just by not procrastinating. This would implement microtransactions and advertisement revenue for the game which would in turn go to charity making the game beneficial for all audiences.
